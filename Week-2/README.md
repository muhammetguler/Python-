# Variables / Expressions / Statements

## Exercise 1

Write a program which takes radius of a circle from user and calculate the perimeter and surface of the defined circle.

**You can get the value of pi from math module (from math import pi)**

## Exercise 2

Write a program that calculates the volume of a sphere by taking its radius from user.

## Exercise 3

Write a program that takes a positive number from user and calculate the sum from 0 to that positive number.

**You do not need to use any loops or developed coding**

## Exercise 4

Write a program which replaces the values of two integers.

## Exercise 5

Write a program which takes a lowercase letter as input and print the uppercase version of the given letter.

## Exercise 6

Write a program that takes 3 integers from the user and then prints the sum of odd numbers.

## Exercise 7

There is a cash machine with an infinite supply of 5tl banknotes and 1tl coins inside it.

Write a program that takes an integer as input representing the amount of money requested by a customer. The program then prints the number of banknotes and coins given to the customer. (Machine must prefer giving away banknotes instead of coins if possible)

## Exercise 8

Guess the outcome of each statement. Then check the results.

*Hint: You can multiply strings with integers. It basically performs the concatenation operation n many times.*

- print(int('6') + int('4'))
- print('1' + '4')
- print(int(3.9))
- print(str(5.3) + '2.7')
- print(int('5') * str(0.6))
- print(float('3' + '8.6'))
- print(3.5 + 6.7)
- print(2 ** 3 ** 2 / 32)
- print(str(4.4) + str(7.3))
- print(int(6.5) + float('6.5'))
- print(int(4.5 + 3.2))
- print(int(3.2) + int(float(str(3.2))))

## Exercise 9

We want to simulate a division operation. In order to do that, write a program to prompt the user for 2 integers, dividend and divisor respectively. Perform the division operation and print out the quotient and the remainder.

## Exercise 10

In mathematics and computer science, the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number *x*, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to *x*, denoted as *⌊x⌋*. The fractional part is the sawtooth function, denoted by *{x}* for real x and defined by the formula *{x} = x - ⌊x⌋*. Write a function that takes 3 positive floats from the input and prints out the fractional part of each value respectively. Do not use float-to-int type casting. There might occur some floating-point error, you do not have to deal with that.

*Hint: Integer division by 1 can be helpful to find ⌊x⌋. Notice that for negative numbers, we have to perform extra steps to find ⌊x⌋.*
